# Django Application Security Enhancements

## HTTPS Enforcement
- **SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT**: Redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS**: Ensures browsers only use HTTPS for one year.
- **SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS**: Applies HSTS to all subdomains.
- **SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD**: Allows HSTS policy to be preloaded by browsers.

## Secure Cookies
- **SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE**: Ensures session cookies are sent over HTTPS.
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE**: Ensures CSRF cookies are sent over HTTPS.

## Secure Headers
- **X_FRAME_OPTIONS**: Protects against clickjacking attacks.
- **SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF**: Prevents MIME-type sniffing.
- **SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER**: Enables browser's XSS protection.

## Deployment
- SSL/TLS certificates were configured for HTTPS in the web server (Nginx/Apache).
- Online tools were used to validate the certificate and headers.

## Testing
- All headers validated using cURL and SSL Labs.
- Verified HTTPS redirects and secure cookie transmission.

## Areas for Improvement
- Periodically audit security configurations.
- Add monitoring tools to detect potential HTTPS issues.
